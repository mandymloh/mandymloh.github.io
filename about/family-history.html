            <h3>About</h3>
            <br>

            <p>
            I’ve moved a lot in my life for various opportunities (four times
            just in the past five years)! Whether it was moving back to Los
            Angeles on my own at the age of 17, going to college in the Pacific
            Northwest or living in the Mitten State (Grand Rapids, Michigan)
            for two years for work, I’ve had to become self-reliant in making
            the food that I crave because it wasn’t always readily accessible
            in the locations I lived in, and money isn’t always abundant.
            <br>
            <br>

            As I often mention, growing up with more than half of my family in
            the food business meant many yummy treats for me, always! Family throughout
            my mother’s side ran local food businesses in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
            My Grandfather and Uncle ran a Hainanese chicken rice hawker stall, while my
            Aunt ran a curry laksa hawker stall for many years. At home, my Grandma
            and mom loved cooking agak agak style (Malay term for "estimate").
            She relied heavily on her intuition for flavors and somehow the dish always
            turned out delicious! &#x1F923; My father is a Head Chef and has been working
            in the Cantonese-Chinese restaurant scene for the past 45 years. He owned
            and ran a successful Seafood Cantonese-Chinese restaurant in Kuala Lumpur,
            Malaysia for 15 of those years. My father says Cantonese-Chinese restaurants
            are a dying form of art as there is declining interest for people to enter
            and learn this type of labor-intensive work.

              This website is dedicated to:

              <ul>
                  <li>documenting and sharing recipes so the knowledge doesn’t disappear from this world, and</li>
                  <li>introducing lesser-known flavors and ingredients.</li>
              </ul>
      
              Follow me on my learning journey as I try new recipes, make my favorite ones
              at home, and document best-selling recipes from my father’s restaurant.
