        <h3>About</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        I’ve moved a lot in my life for various opportunities (four times
        just in the past five years)! Whether it was moving back to Los
        Angeles on my own at the age of 17, going to college in the Pacific
        Northwest or living in the Mitten State (Grand Rapids, Michigan)
        for two years for work, I’ve had to become self-reliant in making
        the food that I crave because it wasn’t always readily accessible
        in the locations I lived in, and money isn’t always abundant.
        <br>
        <br>
        As I often mention, growing up with more than half of my family in
        the food business meant many yummy treats for me, always! Family throughout
        my mother’s side ran local food businesses in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
        My Grandfather and Uncle ran a Hainanese chicken rice hawker stall, while my
        Aunt ran a curry laksa hawker stall for many years. At home, my Grandma
        and mom would cook and she loved cooking agak agak style (Malay term for estimate).
        She relied heavily on her intuition for flavors and somehow the dish always
        turned out delicious! &#x1F923; My father is a Head Chef and has been working
        in the Cantonese-Chinese restaurant scene for the past 45 years. He owned
        and ran a successful Seafood Cantonese-Chinese restaurant in Kuala Lumpur,
        Malaysia for 15 of those years. My father says Cantonese-Chinese restaurants
        are a dying form of art as there is declining interest for people to enter
        and learn this type of labor-intensive work.

           This website is dedicated to:

           <ul>
               <li>documenting and sharing recipes so the knowledge doesn’t disappear from this world, and</li>
               <li>introducing lesser-known flavors and ingredients.</li>
           </ul>
   
           Follow me on my learning journey as I try new recipes, make my favorite ones
           at home, and document best-selling recipes from my father’s restaurant.
